# RandomHandler
## Well, hello! :D
* A simple Discord bot source code that has a dynamic command handler; I use it on all my bots so it should do the job for you too!
* Start the bot by changing the values in config.json, then running "node ." OR "node index.js" in a terminal that is running in the bots dir.
* You can suggest ideas in issues and I will look into them. Feel free to star this project if you like it.

## TO-DO:
*    - Add more commands (I am to lazy, but, I will get to it)
*    -
*    -
