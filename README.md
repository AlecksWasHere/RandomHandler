# RandomHandler
## Well, hello! :D
* A simple Discord bot source code that has a dynamic command handler; I use it on all my bots so it should do the job for you too!
* Start the bot by changing the values in config.json, then running "node ." OR "node index.js" in a terminal that is running in the bots dir.
* You can suggest ideas in issues and I will look into them. Feel free to star this project if you like it.
* Keep in mind that the prefix of this bot is `?`, you can change it at config.json.

## Requirements:
* NODE.JS
* Discord.JS
* A brain .w.
* A Discord bot token
* Finaaaaaaaally, a way to host this thing. (Can be done locally or on a real host)

## TO-DO:
*    - Add more commands (I am to lazy, but, I will get to it)
